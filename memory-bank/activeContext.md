# Active Context: BeaverHabits

## Current Work Focus

The current focus was on implementing a "remember me" option on the login screen to enhance user convenience.

## Recent Changes

-   Modified `beaverhabits/routes.py`:
    -   Added a `ui.checkbox` for "Remember me" on the `/login` page.
    -   Updated the `try_login` function to store the user's email and a `remember_me` flag in `app.storage.user` if the checkbox is selected.
    -   Implemented logic to clear stored login information if the checkbox is not selected.
    -   Pre-filled the email input field on the login page with the remembered email, if available.
    -   Added `Optional[RedirectResponse]` return type hints to `habit_page` and `gui_habit_page_heatmap` and added checks for `None` habit objects, redirecting to `/gui` if a habit is not found.
    -   Simplified `get_current_list_id` to only retrieve from `app.storage.user`, removing reliance on `context.client.page.query` to resolve a Pylance error.

## Next Steps

-   Verify the "remember me" functionality by running the application and testing the login flow.
-   Ensure no new Pylance errors or runtime issues were introduced.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   **Security vs. Convenience:** Decided against storing passwords directly in `app.storage.user` due to security concerns, opting instead to only remember the email and rely on browser password managers.
-   **NiceGUI Storage:** `app.storage.user` is used for client-side persistence of user preferences.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   NiceGUI's `app.storage.user` is a convenient way to persist user-specific data across sessions.
-   Careful handling of `Optional` types is crucial in Python with type checkers like Pylance to avoid runtime errors and improve code robustness.
-   The `request.query_params` is a more robust way to access URL query parameters in FastAPI/NiceGUI page functions compared to `context.client.page.query` in some contexts.
